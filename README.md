- **Backend**: Node.js and Express for the REST API, connected to MongoDB for data storage.
- **Frontend**: React for the user interface with Axios for making API requests.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed. You can download it from [here](https://nodejs.org/).
- **MongoDB**: You can use a local MongoDB instance or a cloud-based service like MongoDB Atlas.
